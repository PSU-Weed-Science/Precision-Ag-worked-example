Welcome to the Precision Ag worked examples repository! 👋👨‍🌾👩‍🌾

In this repository is a .RMD file that will take you through some basics of working with yield data over a whole field. 
The current .RMD is meant to demonstrate the basics and order of operations. We'll go over different methods to create a field border, filtering, plotting, and raster stacking. 
After that, we'll do a quick example on using a multi-year data to create yield stability zones. 
If you need to revisit anything, remember to use the outline to jump to your sections, but always be careful to make sure your objects are what you think they are!

tip: I try my best to leave notes and advice along the way


Future endeavors into Precision Agriculture may lead to new tutorials or expansion of the current tutorial. 

Happy coding -Lilly 💕🌱
